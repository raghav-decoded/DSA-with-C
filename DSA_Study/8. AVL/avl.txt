Need for AVL Tree
    All operations are of order O(h) in a BST where h is the height of the tree
    If the tree is not planned properly the height can get as high as n (skewed)
    for an upper bound of O(nlogn) we need balanced trees

What is an AVL Tree?
    Height balanced BST
    Balanced Factor <= 1
    Balanced Factor = Height of Right Subtree - Height of Left Subtree
    Can be -1,0,1 in an AVL Tree
