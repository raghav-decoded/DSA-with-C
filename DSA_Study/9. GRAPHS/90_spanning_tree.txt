A subgraph is a subset of the graph
    
    Graph:
        0 - 1
        | \ |
        3 - 2
         \ /
          4
         / \

Connected graph
    A graph in which there is a path from one point to another
    if there are a disconnected points: disconnected graph
Complete graph
    undirected graph
    every pair of unique vertices is connected by a unique edge

Spanning Tree
    A connected subgraph S of a graph G(V,E)
    All vertices of G must be present in S
    No of edges in S = V - 1
A complete graph has n^(n-2) spanning trees.

Spanning Tree Cost
    Sum of weights of all edges in the spanning tree
    minimum spanning tree: tree with minimum cost

Graph:
    0 - 1
    | X |
    3 - 2
Spanning Tree:
    0   1
      X  
    3 - 2  
    Cost = C02 + C13 + C23
