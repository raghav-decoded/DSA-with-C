 Binary Tree

    Binary Tree
    if Tree <= 2 children (0,1,2)
    Tree of degree 2 

    A tree is made up of nodes and edges.
    n nodes = n-1 edges
    Degree = number of direct children
    Degree of a tree = Highest degree of a node among all nodes

    Types of Binary Trees
        Full or strict 
            All nodes have either 0 or 2 children
        Perfect 
            Internal nodes have 2 children + Leaf nodes are on same level
        Complete 
            All levels are completely filled
            or
            If the last node is not completely filled, nodes should be as left as possible
        Degenerate
            Every parent Node has only 1 child
        Skewed Trees
            Left
            Right
