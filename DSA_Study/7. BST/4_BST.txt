Binary Search Trees
    It is a type of Binary Tree

    Properties
        All nodes of the left sub-tree have lesser value than the root.
        All nodes of the right sub-tree have higher value than the root.
        Left and Right sub-tree are also BST.
        There are no duplicate nodes.
        In-Order Traversal of a BST array sorted in ascending order.

This Tree is a BST.

This is not a BST.

For a tree with a given height H
The maximum number of nodes on all levels is:
  1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^H = 2^(H+1)−1
If the number of nodes is N:
  2^(H+1)−1 >= N
  2^(H+1) >= N + 1
Taking logarithm base(2) both sides
  (H+1)log(2) >= log(N+1)
  H >= log(N+1) - 1
